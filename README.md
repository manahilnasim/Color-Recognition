### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/real-time-color-detection.git
   
###Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd real-time-color-detection
###Install the required dependencies:
pip install opencv-python pandas numpy
###Running the Application
Execute the script color_detector.py to start the color detection application:
python color_detector.py
###Usage
Once the application starts, it will access the webcam.
Click on any point in the video feed to detect the color at that position.
The detected color's name and RGB values will be displayed on the screen.
